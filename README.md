# Climbing Jack's Arrow

A dark, atmospheric take on the classic Jack and the Beanstalk tale. Navigate treacherous beanstalks as Jack, collecting treasure to save your ailing mother while evading hostile giants and creatures in a world where stealth and weight management are key to survival.

##  Overview

You are Jack, a young boy venturing into dangerous territory atop mystical beanstalks to steal treasure from giants and hybrid monsters. But there's a catch: the more treasure you carry, the harder it becomes to escape. Every item weighs you down, affecting your movement and ability to hide from the creatures that hunt you.

##  Story

Jack's mother, Jane, is gravely ill and needs expensive medical treatment. When a mysterious Satyr offers Jack magical beans promising untold riches, desperation pushes Jack to accept. The beans grow into a massive beanstalk leading to the giants' realm—a hostile wilderness filled with treasures and dangers alike.

Unknown to Jack, the Satyr is manipulating him as part of a heretical cult's plan to obtain the legendary golden egg, prophesied to bring about the end of the world. Will Jack save his mother, or become an unwitting pawn in a darker scheme?

##  Core Features

### Stealth & Detection System
- **Silhouette-based detection**: Giants track you based on your visibility
- **Detection meter**: The longer you're exposed, the more paranoid enemies become
- **Grass coat camouflage**: Hide in shadows and vegetation to avoid detection
- **Hoard phase**: Once detected, giants aggressively hunt you down

### Weight & Encumbrance Mechanics
- **Dynamic movement**: The more items you carry, the slower and clumsier Jack becomes
- **Risk vs. Reward**: Carry more treasure for bigger profits, but risk being unable to escape
- **Tripping system**: Overencumbrance can cause Jack to stumble and drop items
- **Inventory management**: 6 treasure slots + 3 permanent equipment slots

### Inventory System
**Permanent Equipment:**
- Weapon (starts with nothing, equipment: Gas Bomb)
- Grass coat (for camouflage)
- Speed Potion

**Treasure Bag:** Up to 6 valuable items that can be sold to move on to the next level, and for your mother's treatment

##  Art Direction

**Style Influences:**
- **Mike Mignola's Hellboy**: High-contrast colors with dramatic shadows
- **Love, Death, & Robots ("How Zeke Got Religion")**: Vibrant colors masking underlying dread
- **Diablo II**: Foreboding isometric environments
- **Super Mario RPG**: Classic isometric perspective with depth

**Visual Approach:**
- 32x32 pixel art with detailed isometric perspective
- Bright, beautiful colors that contrast with dark, uncomfortable themes
- 2D/3D hybrid aesthetic
- Emphasis on creating unease beneath a whimsical surface

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: #C20114 (Blood Red)
- Secondary: #6C5661 (Dusty Purple)
- Accent: #260F10 (Deep Shadow)

##  Technical Details

**Engine & Tools:**
- Unity 6000.1.17f1+
- C# scripting in Visual Studio 2022
- Aseprite for pixel art creation
- Custom isometric controller system

**Key Systems Implemented:**
- Isometric movement and camera system
- Weight-based player physics
- Line-of-sight detection mechanics
- Dynamic inventory management
- State-based enemy AI

##  What I Learned

This prototype explores several complex game design challenges:

1. **Weight Mechanics**: Implementing realistic encumbrance that affects gameplay without being frustrating
2. **Stealth in Isometric Space**: Creating a silhouette-based detection system that works from a top-down perspective
3. **Risk Management Gameplay**: Balancing the player's greed (carry more treasure) against safety (ability to escape)
4. **Atmospheric Pixel Art**: Combining bright colors with foreboding themes in an isometric perspective
5. **State Machine AI**: Programming enemies that transition between patrol, suspicious, and hunting states

**Challenges Solved:**
- Implementing smooth isometric movement in Unity's 3D space
- Creating readable visual feedback for detection states in pixel art
- Balancing movement penalties to feel realistic but not punishing
- Managing Git version control for Unity projects (excluding Library files)

##  How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpineCrow/Climbing_Jacks_Arrow.git
```

2. **Open in Unity:**
   - Requires Unity 6000.1.17f1 or up to date
   - Open the project folder in Unity Hub

3. **Play:**
   - Open the main scene in `Assets/Scenes/`
   - Press Play in the Unity Editor

**Note:** The Library folder is not included in this repository as it's auto-generated by Unity. When you first open the project, Unity will regenerate all necessary files.

##  Current Status

This is a **prototype/early development build** showcasing core mechanics:
- ✅ Basic isometric movement
- ✅ Weight-based movement penalties
- ✅ Inventory system foundation
- ✅ Detection/stealth mechanics (in progress)
- 🔄 Enemy AI (in development)
- 🔄 Multiple beanstalk levels (planned)
- 🔄 Full narrative implementation (planned)

## Game Inspirations

- **Darkwood** - Atmospheric lighting and tension
- **Don't Starve** - Isometric survival mechanics
- **Silent Hill** - Psychological horror atmosphere
- **Lethal Company** - Item collection and inventory management
- **Death Stranding** - Weight and balance mechanics
- **Hitman** - Stealth and detection systems

## Developer

**Landon Alexander III**

This project was created as part of my game design portfolio to demonstrate:
- Mechanical design (stealth, weight systems)
- Narrative design (dark fairy tale adaptation)
- Technical implementation (Unity, C#)
- Visual direction (pixel art, isometric perspective)
